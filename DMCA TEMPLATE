DMCA
For owners of copyright (DMCA):


This site does not store any illegal files on its server. We only index and link to content provided by other sites.


None of these files are uploaded, hosted or transmitted by our server.

It's all text and links (like Google search indexes) that are provided solely by this site's users. Users find posts on other internet blogs/forums and then post them here in order to share what they consider to be good content.


All trademarks, Videos, trade names, service marks, copyrighted work, logos referenced herein belong to their respective owners/companies. Leaking Hub is not responsible for what users upload to 3rd party sites. We urge all copyright owners, to recognize that the links contained within this site are located somewhere else on the web are from other various site. If you have any legal issues please contact appropriate media file owners / hosters.


So If you are an individual developer, and you think your files are shared by some of our users you should find the actual links and send report or DMCA notice to the free-hosts server that stored your copyrighted materials.


Sending it to us doesn't solve the problem, even if we try to remove all of the posts and links and ban users, they could register a new account in our site and share the links again, so it's not really possible, and also removing the text links and pages is useless there are lots of cached pages on the internet, and we don't have access to those free-hosts, so we can't remove those shared files from free-hosts.

"linking to infringing content is not illegal, The law is currently unsettled with regard to websites that contain links to infringing material."

Thank you for understanding.
